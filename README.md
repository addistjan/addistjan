## 🧠 About Me

I’m a machine learning enthusiast with hands-on experience in data analysis, model building, and working with large language models. I enjoy turning data into useful insights and building practical solutions using Python and modern ML tools.

During my SIWES program, I worked in a large computer laboratory with over 750 systems, where I gained strong technical exposure, system support experience, and teamwork skills in a fast-paced environment. This experience improved my problem-solving ability, attention to detail, and understanding of real-world IT operations.

I’m continuously learning and building projects in machine learning and LLMs, with a growing interest in applied AI, data-driven products, and intelligent systems.
